# 2D Physics Simulator

This is a web app, which offers simple 2d physics simulations. Made with Matter.js & React.

**I am still looking for a good name for this web app. If you have any suggestions, share it with me at sahithyan2701@gmail.com**

## Introduction

I started this project because I wanted to check if my answers were correct (the questions are based on **Basic Mechanics**). I came across many solutions for my problem. But I found some problems in all of them.

For example,

I found out *Interactive Physics*. But it is not free.   
I found out *Steps*. But it didn't even allow me to change the mass of an object.

So I thought, why don't I make a physics simulation app that best suits me.
After several google searches, I found out that I want a physics engine and a renderer to create a physics simulation engine.

Then I started searching for physics engines that were built with JavaScript (because I know only JavaScript). I found Matter.js in a short amount of time. And It had a built-in renderer too.
As I found out a physics engine and a renderer, I started coding.
